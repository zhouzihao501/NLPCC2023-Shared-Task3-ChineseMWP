The implementation of our method: [Solving Math Word Problem with Problem Type Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13844)
Rank 2nd in 18 teams


We propose an ensemble technique that combines the capabilities of the Bert2Tree solver and the LLM solver to leverage their respective advantages and enable the solution of a wider range of MWPS.
